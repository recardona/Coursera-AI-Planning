Coursera-AI-Planning
====================

A repository workspace for the Coursera AI Planning course, offered through the
University of Edinburgh during the Spring of 2013.

--------
###Repository Structure:
This repository is organized into weeks, following the organization of the
class' Coursera website.  Each week folder has at least two folders:

####/src/
Folder for the source code that was needed to solve interesting problems for
that week.  By 'interesting', I mean:
* anything that the instructors explicitly instructed us to do
* any toy problem that was used as an example to explain concepts
* anything that was presented as a quiz problem for which code was required

There may be some duplication of code across the weeks, in an attempt to make
each week a self-contained unit.

####/doc/
Folder for notes that I took using [Notability](http://www.gingerlabs.com/cont/notability.php).
Warning: These are big files!
